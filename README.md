# interactive-super-kamiokande

A project generated from [aunty](https://github.com/abcnews/aunty)'s `preact` app template.

## Developing

Note: `aframe` and `aframe-react` can't be installed with npm as their `package.json`s have faulty `engine` fields that won't let `npm install` run unless you're using Node.js v4.6! To work around this, install using yarn, which can ignore engine requirments:

```
yarn install --ignore-engines
```
